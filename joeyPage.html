		Hello ! My name is Joey. I could ramble about my life for a while but I’ll mention some key things about me.
    Im 19, a guy (trans FtM, in early few months of transition), and I grew up in Los Angeles, California. I love marching band and have been in it since my freshman year of high school! I also love drawing, figure skating, animation, and doing service for my music fraternity, Kappa Kappa Psi. I also definitely like to sleep too much for my own good but I’m taking advantage of it as much as I can right now.
    
    I am currently the Webmaster for my fraternity so I’m super excited to learn new web dev things! I’ve gotten confused and overwhelmed with working with AWS and Dreamweaver in the past so I am looking forward to getting a chance to understand it better.
    
    After GIMM I’m not quite sure what I plan to do. Assuming things continue to work well with my boyfriend, I’ll probably stay in school another year or so with him to pick up a Digital Media certificate and then submit my portfolio wherever possible to see what’s available out there for me.
